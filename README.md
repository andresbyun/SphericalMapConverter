# Spherical Map Converter
## Description
A simple Python program that takes in an image and transforms it into something akin to an Equilateral Projection.  

The underlying idea is to resize the image to a 2:1 ratio and then perform the distortions at the poles.

## Motivation
This script was written in order to facilitate the creation of spherical textures from already existing images in a relatively quick and easy way.
